<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! I am excited to share my work with you. My name is Nurin Aina Saffiya.I am 20 years old and I am currently studying a diploma in Information Technology at KPTM Batu Pahat. I created this website as part of an assignment to showcase my skills and share my knowledge with others.</p>
<p>On this website, you will find three web pages: a homepage, a conversion page, and a conversion calculator. The homepage provides an overview of my work and experience, while the conversion page explains the conversion process and allows users to input data. The conversion calculator is a tool that performs conversions based on user input.</p>
<p>I hope you find this website informative and useful. Thank you for visiting!</p>
